    </ul>
    <h4>Fleischmann's Easy Pizza Crust:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
      <li>
        2 (.25 ounce) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise
        Yeast
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>

    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL Pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch
        pizza pans.
      </li>

      <li>
        Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic
        powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until
        smooth. Set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large
        bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute.
        Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky
        dough forms.
      </li>

      <li>
        Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and
        elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise
        yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
      </li>

      <li>
        Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of
        dough onto the prepared pizza pans.
      </li>

      <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>

      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is
        bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom
        oven racks halfway through baking.
      </li>
